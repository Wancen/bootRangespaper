Derive overlap rate of  caQTLs detected in human liver tissue-SNPs associated with total cholesterol: 
   * *GRanges_construct.R*(Preprocess) -> *segBootranges.R*(perform bootRanges) -> *var.R*(Variance of the rate of overlaps and $z$ score) -> *fit_splines.R*(conditional density plot) -> *plot.R*
   * *bootstrap.R*: perform conventional shuffling.
