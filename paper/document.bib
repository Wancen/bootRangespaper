Significant enrichment (or depletion) of genomic features is anticipated to be biologically important. Detection of genomic regions having enrichment of certain features and estimation of corresponding statistical significance rely on the expected null distribution generated by a permutation model. We discuss different genome-wide permutation approaches, present examples where the permutation strategy affects the null model and show that the confidence in estimating statistical significance of genome-wide enrichment might depend on the choice of the permutation approach. In those cases, where biologically relevant constraints are unclear, it is preferable to examine whether key conclusions are consistent, irrespective of the choice of the randomization strategy. <br><br>© The Author 2013.

Yet, given the large number of regulatory datasets, researchers are posed with a challenge of how to efficiently utilize them to interpret the functional impact of SNP sets.Results: We developed the GenomeRunner web server to automate systematic statistical analysis of SNP sets within a regulatory context. Besides defining the functional impact of SNP sets, GenomeRunner implements novel regulatory similarity/differential analyses, and cell type-specific regulatory enrichment analysis. Validated against literature- and disease ontology-based approaches, analysis of 39 disease/trait-associated SNP sets demonstrated that the functional impact of SNP sets corresponds to known disease relationships. We identified a group of autoimmune diseases with SNPs distinctly enriched in the enhancers of T helper cell subpopulations, and demonstrated relevant cell type-specificity of the functional impact of other SNP sets. In summary, we show how systematic analysis of genomic data within a regulatory context can help interpreting the functional impact of SNP sets.Availability and Implementation: GenomeRunner web server is freely available at http://www.integrativegenomics.org/.Contact:  mikhail.dozmorov@gmail.comSupplementary information:  Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.}",

abstract = {Summary
Identifying the molecular mechanisms by which genome-wide association study (GWAS) loci influence traits remains challenging. Chromatin accessibility quantitative trait loci (caQTLs) help identify GWAS loci that may alter GWAS traits by modulating chromatin structure, but caQTLs have been identified in a limited set of human tissues. Here we mapped caQTLs in human liver tissue in 20 liver samples and identified 3,123 caQTLs. The caQTL variants are enriched in liver tissue promoter and enhancer states and frequently disrupt binding motifs of transcription factors expressed in liver. We predicted target genes for 861 caQTL peaks using proximity, chromatin interactions, correlation with promoter accessibility or gene expression, and colocalization with expression QTLs. Using GWAS signals for 19 liver function and/or cardiometabolic traits, we identified 110 colocalized caQTLs and GWAS signals, 56 of which contained a predicted caPeak target gene. At the LITAF LDL-cholesterol GWAS locus, we validated that a caQTL variant showed allelic differences in protein binding and transcriptional activity. These caQTLs contribute to the epigenomic characterization of human liver and help identify molecular mechanisms and genes at GWAS loci.}
