@article{Davis2022matchranges,
	abstract = {Deriving biological insights from genomic data commonly requires comparing attributes of selected genomic loci to a null set of loci. The selection of this null set is non trivial, as it requires careful consideration of potential covariates, a problem that is exacerbated by the non-uniform distribution of genomic features including genes, enhancers, and transcription factor binding sites. Propensity score-based covariate matching methods allow selection of null sets from a pool of possible items while controlling for multiple covariates; however, existing packages do not operate on genomic data classes and can be slow for large data sets making them difficult to integrate into genomic workflows. To address this, we developed matchRanges, a propensity score-based covariate matching method for the efficient and convenient generation of matched null ranges from a set of background ranges within the Bioconductor framework.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

This question arises, for example, when interpreting ChIP-Seq or RNA-Seq data in functional terms. Because genome organization is complex, answering this question is non-trivial.<br><br><strong>SUMMARY:</strong> We present Genomic Association Test (GAT), a tool for estimating the significance of overlap between multiple sets of genomic intervals. GAT implements a null model that the two sets of intervals are placed independently of one another, but allows each set's density to depend on external variables, for example, isochore structure or chromosome identity. GAT estimates statistical significance based on simulation and controls for multiple tests using the false discovery rate.<br><br><strong>AVAILABILITY:</strong> GAT's source code, documentation and tutorials are available at http://code.google.com/p/genomic-association-tester.},

Significant enrichment (or depletion) of genomic features is anticipated to be biologically important. Detection of genomic regions having enrichment of certain features and estimation of corresponding statistical significance rely on the expected null distribution generated by a permutation model. We discuss different genome-wide permutation approaches, present examples where the permutation strategy affects the null model and show that the confidence in estimating statistical significance of genome-wide enrichment might depend on the choice of the permutation approach. In those cases, where biologically relevant constraints are unclear, it is preferable to examine whether key conclusions are consistent, irrespective of the choice of the randomization strategy. <br><br>{\copyright} The Author 2013.

@article{GenomicRunner,
	abstract = {{Motivation: The growing amount of regulatory data from the ENCODE, Roadmap Epigenomics and other consortia provides a wealth of opportunities to investigate the functional impact of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Yet, given the large number of regulatory datasets, researchers are posed with a challenge of how to efficiently utilize them to interpret the functional impact of SNP sets.Results: We developed the GenomeRunner web server to automate systematic statistical analysis of SNP sets within a regulatory context. Besides defining the functional impact of SNP sets, GenomeRunner implements novel regulatory similarity/differential analyses, and cell type-specific regulatory enrichment analysis. Validated against literature- and disease ontology-based approaches, analysis of 39 disease/trait-associated SNP sets demonstrated that the functional impact of SNP sets corresponds to known disease relationships. We identified a group of autoimmune diseases with SNPs distinctly enriched in the enhancers of T helper cell subpopulations, and demonstrated relevant cell type-specificity of the functional impact of other SNP sets. In summary, we show how systematic analysis of genomic data within a regulatory context can help interpreting the functional impact of SNP sets.Availability and Implementation: GenomeRunner web server is freely available at http://www.integrativegenomics.org/.Contact:  mikhail.dozmorov@gmail.comSupplementary information:  Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.}},
