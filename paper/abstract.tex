\abstract{
\bootranges provides fast functions for generation of
bootstrapped genomic ranges representing the null hypothesis in enrichment
analysis. We show that shuffling or permutation schemes may result in
overly narrow test statistic null distributions, while creating new
range sets with a block bootstrap preserves local genomic correlation
structure and generates more reliable null distributions.  It can also
be used in more complex analyses, such as accessing correlations
between cis-regulatory elements (CREs) and genes across cell types or
providing optimized thresholds, e.g. log fold change (logFC) from
differential analysis. The \bootranges functions are available in the
R/Bioconductor package \emph{nullranges}
at \url{https://nullranges.github.io/nullranges}.\\
