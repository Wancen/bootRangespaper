\abstract{
\bootranges provides fast functions for generation of
bootstrapped genomic ranges representing the null hypothesis in enrichment
analysis. \wancen{As part of a modular workflow, it has great flexibility to compute interested test statistic by incorporating other packages}. We show that shuffling or permutation schemes may result in
overly narrow test statistic null distributions \wancen{and would lead to overestimation of the significance}, while creating new
range sets with a block bootstrap preserves local genomic correlation
structure and generates more reliable null distributions.  It can also
be used in more complex analyses, such as accessing correlations
between cis-regulatory elements (CREs) and genes across cell types or
providing optimized thresholds, e.g. log fold change (logFC) from
differential analysis. The \bootranges functions are available in the
R/Bioconductor package \emph{nullranges}
at \url{https://bioconductor.org/packages/nullranges}.\\
