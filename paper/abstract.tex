\abstract{\bootranges provides fast functions for generation of
bootstrapped genomic regions representing the null hypothesis in
enrichment analysis. We show that shuffling or permutation schemes may result
in overly narrow test statistics null distributions, while creating new feature sets
with a block bootstrap preserves local genomic correlation structure and generates
more reliable null distributions.
It can also be used in more complex analyses,
such as computing correlations between cis-regulatory elements (CREs)
and genes across cell types or providing optimized thresholds,
e.g. log fold change (logFC) from differential analysis.
The \bootranges functions are available in the R/Bioconductor
package \emph{nullranges} 
at \url{https://bioconductor.org/packages/nullranges}.\\
